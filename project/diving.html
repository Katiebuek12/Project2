    <p>Diving was introduced into the Olympics in 1904 at the St. Louis Games. The sport was also<br> known as fancy diving due to the acrobatic stunts performed. Women's diving was added in <br>1912. For both men and women, they can compete in four different events. In 1984 in Moscow <br> the ban against China was lifted and they were able to compete as well. Three events<br> were removed due to the popularity of newer events.</p>
